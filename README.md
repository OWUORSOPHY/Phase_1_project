## Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. I will be exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office and translating my findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Understanding the nature of data
In order to have better understanding performance of the movies,I opted for  imdb.title.basics, imdb.title.ratings and bom.movie_gross datasets.
The datasets gives information on movie genres, ratings, domestic gross, foreign gross and the runtime  of the movies
